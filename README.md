# TEAM_NULL's OOP Project

This repository is created specifically for the OOP course's final project :3

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. Motivation

This project is created with the hopes to not only pass the OOP course, but to also gain valuable knowledge regarding the uses of Java programming language and the application of OOP's core principles. In addition, our team has been able to learn how a simple (yet not really simple) Java 2D game functions, using only the internal Java libraries.
We hope that this project will prove to be useful for you, who is currently reading these lines, in your path to learning Java and game programming. Love, TEAM_NULL.
